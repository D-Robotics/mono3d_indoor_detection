# Function Introduction

The mono3d_indoor_detection package is an example of indoor 3D object detection algorithm developed using the hobot_dnn package, which utilizes a 3D detection model and indoor data on the Horizon Sunrise X3 development board for model inference with the BPU processor.
The 3D detection model is related to sensors and sensor parameters. The performance may vary under different sensor and parameter settings. Therefore, this package does not directly subscribe to topics of type sensors/msg/Image by default, but conducts inference by reading local images to detect object categories and 3D positioning information. The AI information will be published through topics, and the results will also be rendered and saved on images in the 'result' directory during program execution.

The supported indoor object detection categories of the algorithm are as follows:

```
1. Charging base
2. Trash can
3. Slipper
```
Each category includes information such as length, width, height, rotation, and depth. The length, width, and height of an object correspond to the dimensions of a hexahedron, and the depth refers to the distance from the camera to the object. The units for the parameters above are in millimeters. Rotation represents the orientation of an object relative to the camera in radians, with a range of -pi to pi, indicating the angle between the forward direction of the object in the camera coordinate system and the x-axis of the camera coordinate system.

The package releases AI Msg containing 3D detection information for external use, and users can subscribe to the published AI Msg for application development.
The detailed description of the AI Msg is as follows:

```
# Target Message

# Target type name, such as:Charging dock, trash can, slippers
# charging_base/trash_can/slipper
string type

# Tracking ID of the target, currently set as 0
uint64 track_id

# Detection box, 3D detection vertex information described using points, see "Key Points" section below
Roi[] rois

# Attribute information, attributes include the 'type' and 'value' fields.
Attribute[] attributes
The Attribute[] array includes the following information:
type       description
length     Object length
width      Object width
height     Object height
depth      Object depth
rotation   Object orientation relative to the camera
score      Confidence score of the object category, closer to 1 indicates higher confidence
x          x-coordinate of the object in the camera coordinate system
y          y-coordinate of the object in the camera coordinate system
z          z-coordinate of the object in the camera coordinate system

# Hexahedral corner points, the spatial occupation of a three-dimensional object in the image is described by a hexahedron, which includes 8 vertices.
The order of the 8 vertices is as follows, each vertex contains the x, y coordinates on the image.
The left hexahedron indicates facing away from the camera, and the right hexahedron indicates facing the camera

The above log snippet captures the processing results of a frame, indicating that the target type received in the AI message is "trash_can",
providing three-dimensional information, distance, and rotation angle for the trash can.

In the example, the result of inference on a locally read image is rendered on the image and saved in the "result" directory in the current path.
